<h1>Superstore - Analysis of Product Segmentation</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This Superstore data set was expanded from 51K to 1 million rows. The Regional Sales Director would like to know which product segment and which customer segment are performing the best, and why? For this project, I conducted an analysis to identify the best-performing product segment and make data-driven recommendations based on orders,customers, product categories, and returns.
